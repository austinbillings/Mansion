**Mansion** is a flexbox-based CSS grid, layout, and breakpoint framework, written in LESS, for responsive layout classes that just make sense. Let's dig in.

## Assumptions
1. This guide, like most employers of front-end developers, assumes you have solid knowledge of **CSS** (duh), **HTML** (duh), the new CSS **Flexbox** module, and, believe it or not, Twitter's **Bootstrap**.
  
  > If you aren't familiar with Bootstrap yet, you may still be able to follow along nodding and smiling, and perhaps not missing much. We're going to be talking about its *grid system* mostly, and relating that to how **Mansion**'s works, and what's different. Some other Bootstrap topics are relevant here, like its *breakpoints* and *css-reset* stuff. That'll come in a later bit.

2. We're also assuming that you want a **responsive flex layout framework**, preferably for use in **the real world**. 
  
  > What is meant by a **responsive flex layout framework?** Pretty simply, it's a system of display styles that let a web developer *quickly* and easily create complex, vertical and horizontal block layouts. The *responsive* bit means it should respond to various circumstances, whether it's viewed on an iPhone or a MacBook (or a potato, for that matter). that *flex* bit indicates that it's a **flexbox**-based framework. If you've made it this far, you probably know what flexbox is.
  
  > What is meant by the **real world**? If I could explain it, well, it wouldn't be the *real world*. You're on your own with that one.
